# PolarisJS
Polaris Web Application in Javascript

Polaris is the go-to web application for San Juan County WA citizens and employees to get information on property, critical areas, and other maps.

## Features
- Search by parcel number, address, road or island name
- Use the identify button and click on the map to receive information about property
- Toggle map layers on or off in the Map Contents window
- Create PDF or images of the map in the Print window
- Make annotations and draw on the map using the Draw window

## Installation
Polaris requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) to be installed.

Run the following commands:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/SJCGIS/PolarisJS.git
npm install
npm build
```
This creates the necessary files in the `dist` folder. Copy and paste the contents of the `dist` folder to a web enabled location on a web server i.e. ` C:\inetpub\wwwroot\polaris`.
