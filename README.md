# PolarisJS
Polaris Web Application in Javascript

Polaris is the go-to web application for San Juan County WA citizens and employees to get information on property, critical areas, and other maps.

## Features
- Search by parcel number, address, road or island name
- Use the identify button and click on the map to receive information about property
- Toggle map layers on or off in the Map Contents window
- Create PDF or images of the map in the Print window
- Make annotations and draw on the map using the Draw window

## Installation
- Download and extract or clone the repository into web-enabled directory (ex. c:\inetpub\wwwroot) on a web server.
- Map layers and basemaps still require internet access and are not installed with Polaris.
